# Khala Project Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

Khala is a shared TypeScript code database that provides three types of indexing:

1. **Literal Index**: Direct code search and matching
2. **Dependency Graph**: Function/type relationships and dependencies
3. **Semantic Index**: AI-powered semantic understanding

*Note: The technical overview and architecture will be discussed and defined collaboratively in future phases of the project.*
