# Chain of Thought Rules

## Core Principle
**MVP First, Iterate Fast**

## Planning Process
1. **What's the smallest working unit?** (15-30 min max)
2. **Implement it and test immediately**
3. **Get feedback, make smallest improvement**
4. **Repeat**

## Red Flags (Stop and Simplify)
- Planning >2 steps ahead
- Spending >30 min on one task
- Writing >50 lines without testing
- Creating abstractions for simple problems

## Remember
- Working code > perfect plans
- Small steps > big plans
- Test immediately, improve later
- You can always refactor later
