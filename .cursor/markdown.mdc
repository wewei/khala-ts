# Markdown Guidelines for Khala

## General Principles
- Write clear, concise, and well-structured documentation.
- Use proper English grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
- Prefer active voice and direct instructions.

## Headings
- Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.).
- Only one `#` H1 heading per document (usually the title).
- All other headings should use `##` or lower.
- The first line in a Markdown file should be a top-level heading (`#`).
- Increment heading levels by one (no skipping levels).
- Leave a blank line before and after headings.

## Line Length & Spacing
- Limit lines to 120 characters when possible.
- Leave a blank line between paragraphs, lists, and headings.
- No trailing spaces at the end of lines.
- No multiple consecutive blank lines.

## Lists
- Use `-` for unordered lists, not `*` or `+`.
- Use `1.` for ordered lists (let Markdown auto-number).
- Leave a blank line before and after lists.
- Indent nested list items by two spaces.

## Code Blocks & Inline Code
- Use triple backticks (```) for fenced code blocks.
- **Always specify a language for fenced code blocks** (e.g., ```bash, ```typescript, ```markdown).
- Use single backticks for inline code.
- Leave a blank line before and after code blocks.

## Links & Images
- Use `[text](mdc:url)` for links.
- Use `![alt text](mdc:url)` for images, always provide alt text.
- Reference local images with relative paths.
- Avoid bare URLs; always use descriptive link text.

## Blockquotes
- Use `>` for blockquotes.
- **Do not include blank lines inside blockquotes.**
- Leave a blank line before and after blockquotes.

## Tables
- Use pipes (`|`) to separate columns.
- Align columns with spaces for readability.
- Always include a header row and separator row.

## Emphasis
- **Use asterisks (`*`) for emphasis and strong emphasis, not underscores (`_`).**
- Use `*italic*` for emphasis.
- Use `**bold**` for strong emphasis.
- Do not use HTML tags for emphasis.

## Horizontal Rules
- Use three dashes (`---`) for horizontal rules.
- Leave a blank line before and after.

## Frontmatter
- Use YAML frontmatter (`---`) at the top for metadata if needed.

## Configuration
- Project uses `.markdownlint.json` to configure markdownlint rules.
- Duplicate headings (MD024) are allowed and configured to be disabled.

## Common markdownlint Rules to Avoid Errors/Warnings
- MD001: Only one H1 heading per file. All other headings should use `##` or lower.
- MD002/MD003: Heading levels should increment by one.

- MD012: No multiple consecutive blank lines.
- MD013: Line length (prefer <= 120 chars).
- MD022: Blank line before headings.
- MD023: Headings must start at the beginning of the line.
- MD025: Only one top-level heading per document.
- MD026: No trailing punctuation in headings.
- MD028: **No blank lines inside blockquotes.**
- MD029: Ordered list item prefix should be `1.`
- MD031: Blank lines before and after fenced code blocks.
- MD032: Blank line before lists.
- MD033: Avoid inline HTML.
- MD034: Use Markdown syntax for links, not raw URLs.
- MD036: No emphasis used for document titles.
- MD040: **Fenced code blocks should have a language specified.**
- MD041: First line in file should be a top-level heading (`#`).
- MD049: **Use asterisks for emphasis, not underscores.**
